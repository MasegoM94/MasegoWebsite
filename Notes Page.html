<p style="color:white"> This page is almost like a notepad really. I will be documenting any interesting Data Science related concepts, posts, blogs and podcasts I come across and comment on them. I feel like it is important to constantly learn new things within this field and because of this field is growing exponentially it can be difficult to keep up with the new technologies and concepts so I find it is always better to document them and constantly go back and remind yourself. </p>

In my working experience, it has been difficult to define what I should be doing as a Data Scientist. In many cases you will find that the Data Scientist is responsible for the entire process. However, this post so beautifully defines who should be doing what in the process. I have to thank Nabih for posting this and I do urge companies to consider using this as a blueprint to defining the roles, especially companies that have recently adopted data science and machine learning technologies. </p>

  <p style="color:white"> I came across this news item while looking for more Data Science blogs to start following ( with this ever growing field, one always has to be aware of new methods and techniques and DS blogs is a great place to start investigating). These two guests were students of  <a href="https://explore-datascience.net/" target="_blank"> Explore Data Science Academy </a>  (an academy I actually once applied for and got into the year-long program but made the choice to do my Masters full-time instead). I have to commend the academy for their foresight and this extremely relevant concept for South Africa specifically. I have watched it grow since inception and has evolved to a much needed service, especially going into this Fourth Industrial Revolution. They offer many courses, long and short, taken either full-time or part-time. They have also partnered with some corporates to offer scholarships to students. I am proud of what these students represented here in this brief interview and what the academy of which they attended. I believe it could be a better alternative to a university degree in Data Science and thus recommend it to anyone interested in pursuing a Data Science career</p>

  <p style="color:white"> I have been listening to a number of the <a href="https://www.superdatascience.com/podcast" target="_blank"> Super Data Science </a> podcasts, and found them very informing so I decided to look into their Youtube channel and explore more of their content. I came across a  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE50-dh6JzC6vq132x6i9OPRQusCACf7Y" target="_blank"> Data Science News playlist</a>, which unfortunately hasn't been updated in awhile. However, the stories that we got introduced to by the host are pretty amazing to say the least. I have always had difficulty explaining what I have studied in Lehmann's terms to my family members but these video postings have basically helped me try to explain it with tangible examples. The "news" discussed here has also opened my eyes to how much more vast the field of AI and Data Science has become. I have included some links to a few videos I found interesting.  

  Enjoy

  <p style="color:white"> I titled this one <i>  The week of Gemma Dawson </i> because I felt like I was low-key stalking Gemma at all the meetups where she was presenting this past week. It was a Data Visualisation week. I went to two meetups where Gemma was presenting. The first was on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/rladies-johannesburg/" target="blank"><i>R-Ladies Johannesburg</i></a> meetup in where Gemma showed us some cool tips and tricks for using <i>GGPLot2 </i> (A data visualisation/graphing package used in R). One thing I liked about her is her ability to explain the architecture behind <i>GGPLot2 </i> and how and where to use what. The second meetup was an <a href ="https://www.meetup.com/Explore-AI-JHB-Meetup-Group" target ="blank"><i> Explore-AI </i> </a> meetup that was focused on data visualisation in general. Her talk was brief and she went through visualisations that she found interesting. She also introduced us to various data visualisation sources. I have included the links to these sources (attached to this post). I was very impressed with her insight and wish her all the best with her journey.
