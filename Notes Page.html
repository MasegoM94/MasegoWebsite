<p style="color:white"> This page is almost like a notepad really. I will be documenting any interesting Data Science related concepts, posts, blogs and podcasts I come across and comment on them. I feel like it is important to constantly learn new things within this field and because of this field is growing exponentially it can be difficult to keep up with the new technologies and concepts so I find it is always better to document them and constantly go back and remind yourself. </p>

  <p style="color:white"> I came across this news item while looking for more Data Science blogs to start following ( with this ever growing field, one always has to be aware of new methods and techniques and DS blogs is a great place to start investigating). These two guests were students of  <a href="https://explore-datascience.net/" target="_blank"> Explore Data Science Academy </a>  (an academy I actually once applied for and got into the year-long program but made the choice to do my Masters full-time instead). I have to commend the academy for their foresight and this extremely relevant concept for South Africa specifically. I have watched it grow since inception and has evolved to a much needed service, especially going into this Fourth Industrial Revolution. They offer many courses, long and short, taken either full-time or part-time. They have also partnered with some corporates to offer scholarships to students. I am proud of what these students represented here in this brief interview and what the academy of which they attended. I believe it could be a better alternative to a university degree in Data Science and thus recommend it to anyone interested in pursuing a Data Science career</p>

  <p style="color:white"> I have been listening to a number of the <a href="https://www.superdatascience.com/podcast" target="_blank"> Super Data Science </a> podcasts, and found them very informing so I decided to look into their Youtube channel and explore more of their content.

However, the stories that we got introduced to by the host are pretty amazing to say the least. I have always had difficulty explaining what I have studied in Lehmann's terms to my family members but these video postings have basically helped me try to explain it with tangible examples. The "news" discussed here has also opened my eyes to how much more vast the field of AI and Data Science has become. I have included some links to a few videos I found interesting.

  <p style="color:white"> I titled this one <i>  The week of Gemma Dawson </i> because I felt like I was low-key stalking Gemma at all the meetups where she was presenting this past week. It was a Data Visualisation week. I went to two meetups where Gemma was presenting. The first was on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/rladies-johannesburg/" target="blank"><i>R-Ladies Johannesburg</i></a> meetup in where Gemma showed us some cool tips and tricks for using <i>GGPLot2 </i> (A data visualisation/graphing package used in R). One thing I liked about her is her ability to explain the architecture behind <i>GGPLot2 </i> and how and where to use what. The second meetup was an <a href ="https://www.meetup.com/Explore-AI-JHB-Meetup-Group" target ="blank"><i> Explore-AI </i> </a> meetup that was focused on data visualisation in general. Her talk was brief and she went through visualisations that she found interesting. She also introduced us to various data visualisation sources. I have included the links to these sources (attached to this post). I was very impressed with her insight and wish her all the best with her journey.

  <p style="color:white"> "<i> Prophet </i> is a forecasting procedure implemented in R and Python . It is fast and and provides completely automated forecasts that can be tuned by hand by data scientists and analysts", a quote I sourced from the <i>Prophet website</i>.<i> Prophet</i> doesn't solve all forecasting problems, they do mention on their <i>Facebook Research</i>  page on which kinds of forecasting scenarios that their product/model is best suited for.  One scenario they mention is for "daily or weekly observations where there is a few months of history", and this is how I got introduced to <i>fbProphet</i>. I am currently doing a course on Udemy titled <i> Machine Learning Practical Workout | 8-Real-World Projects </i> and two of the projects used the <i>fbProphet</i> package. I do not know how much I can share so I will generalize. The one case was predicting a rate and the other is predicting a future price of a commodity. From what I saw, the package ws fairly straightforward to use. However, what I wish is that the instructor would explain more of what is happening under the hood of the different commands. One thing I worry about for this package is that one's data needs to be transformed before it is entered into the mechanism. I would like to try it on a big dataset using pyspark. On their page they mention that scaling is not really a problem for time series data, I am guessing because only two variables are required (from what I have been introduced to). From what I see, it would not be ideal for a multi-variable time series problem. The <i>Prophet</i> procedure is an additive regression model (which basically is a linear model where the change in one variable doesn't affect the change in another). The procedure will then output future predictions (dependent on the users specifications), trend line with accompanying uncertainty band, weekly and yearly seasonality plots depending on the type of data entered. This package can be quite powerful if fully understood by the user.

  <div class="grid-item" id="rcorners3">

  <p style="color:white"> I have to admit, I had been struggling with the idea of what an epoch (in neural networks) actually is (Yes, I know I claim I am a Data Scientist and what not but some concepts are not so straightforward). With this Udemy course I am doing I came across epochs in neural networks again . It was probably the best eplanation I have came across. So the instructor described it as <i> each time the weights in the artificial neural networks update</i>. Ah of course that makes sense. I came across another definition which made the concept even clearer on DeepAI.org. They say that epochs are not iterations which is honestly what I have been mistaking them as. More interestingly, they gave a workable example of how an epoch and iteration can interpreted in the case of a reinforcement learning example. To sum it up an epoch would be one completion of task whilst an iteration is an action within a task. I hope that makes sense. I also came across another definition that could ease the understanding of an epoch. This one is in terms of batch sizes. A batch size is the number of data points you want to enter into a model at a time. This is a hyperparameter that is usually considered due to one's machine's computing power. An epoch is then when the entire training data has gone through the neural network once. How long one epoch could take is dependent on the batch size.  Look at us learning and stuff.

  <p style="color:white"> I wanted to bring attention to this page <i>playground.tensorflow.org</i>. To anyone that wants to visualise how a simple neural network can be built and created, this is the page for you. It allows anyone to build a neural network of a regression or classification problem by selecting various parameters including learning rate, activation function etc, adding hidden layers and selecting batch size just to name a few. The page/project was created by Daniel Smikov and Shan Carter and it also provides a simple explanation of what a neural network is. They were also kind to provide their code that created the amazing animation. This tool is great to explain neural networks at a fundamental level.

  <p style="color:white"> The Woman in Data Science (WiDS) podcast is a podcast series hosted by Margot Gerritsen from Standford University. The premise of the show is to interview women doing Data Science in their various industries. I listened to a particular interview with Ya Xu (Head of Data Science global for LinkedIn). I normally get distracted when listening to podcasts and I don't want to work something else while listening to informative podcasts vs entertainment podcasts. Honestly, I was gripped from the onset with this podcast. I think it was I had the connection I had to both the interviewer and interviewee. Being a women in this industry can be tough. In my case I am completely surrounded by men, so it is ard o build connections and trust because they are not a lot of people that look like me. I loved Ya's calmness and how she is unapologetically a woman in her position. She is empowering and I loved how she said the thing that excites her is <i>being able to help her team succeed</i>. I truly stan her. She seems empowering and I am extremely proud of her as well as what this podcast stands for. The interview was truly engaging and I recommend you give it a listen. Big ups to Margot and her team for this intiative.

  <p style="color:white"> For one of the projects available on the Udemy course that I am currently doing, I was introduced to this Image Kernels website. An Image Kernel is a matrix that transforms an image to a specific effect the user would like to apply to that image for example blurring the image. The project had to do with images and using convolutional neural networks to classify these images into classes. In the case of convolutional neural networks, image kernels are used for feature extraction when building the network. This website illustrates how the transformation is done on the image according to whichever effect the user would like to see happen to the image. They illustrate this transformation visually and mathematically. The concept is genius and I truly appreciate the developers of this website for sharing it. They also allow the user to upload an image or video and then apply these kernels to them.

  <p style="color:white"> As mentioned in a previous post, I am doing a Udemy course focused on Machine Learning Projects. One of the projects had to do with classifying images using convolutional neural network. The course itself does a brilliant job of explaining how the CNN will work to classify images. This is also where I got introduced to the <i> 2D Visualisation of a Convolutional Neural Network</i> webpage that illustrates how the convolutional neural network looks when classifying a drawn digit. Now one can see what a convolutional, downsampling (pooling) and fully-connected layer would look like in a CNN model. One can see how the convolutional layer extracts the certain features of the image, downsampling layer reduces the size of inputs of the image and how we eventually flatten the data into fully-connected layers and then get an output/prediction to the network. Seeing this visualisation made it so much easier for me to understand the construction of the network. I suggest this visualisation to anyone who would need a visual understanding of what the different layers of a CNN look like and what they do.

  <p style="color:white"> For this post, I have a question to pose but I will leave that for the end. With the Udemy course that I am doing, there is a project that introduces the use of LeNet-5 structure Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The LeNet CNN has a very specific architecture that was introduction by LeCun et al. in 1998. The basic structure, as seen in the image, has a convolutional -, subsampling -, convolutional -, subsampling - and then convolutional layer used to flatten the data to two fully-connected layers that eventually feels to an output layer. Note this is just one of many architectures that can be used for image classifications. There are also some dimension calculations that are required between the first 5 layers of the network. In the original paper, they used average pooling in the subsampling layer. What I found confusing, which has lead to my question, is can we still call the structure/architecture LeNet if we use a different subsampling method, like maxpooling? I came across a LeNet tutorial that used the maxpooling method instead of average pooling. It was the only LeNet explanation I found that was different, which confused me (thanks DeepLearning.net). This brings me back to my question. What features of the structure make it LeNet? I don't mind settling with just calling it a variation of the original structure but at what point of change from the original structure do we stop calling it a variation?

  <p style="color:white"> In my line of work, evaluating models is very essential when settling on a model. However, in corporate I have noticed that we have a tendency at always looking at the same metrics which I attribute to business having to understand the evaluation versus just the technical person. With this post I just wanted to note the metrics available for the classification problems. Before we get to the metrics, I need to bring attention to the confusion matrix. I have added an example alongside. It is a table that documents the predicted classes against the actual classes and allows us to see how and where there were correct and incorrect predicted classifications. This matrix is important in calculating other metrics that will be discussed.<br>  <br>
  	
  	<i> Accuracy </i> is the most commonly used metric. It gives us the percentage of times the model predicted the correct class. This could be misleading if there is an imbalance in the classes in the data. <br> <br>

  	<i> Misclassification / Error rate </i> gives us the percentage of times the model predicted incorrectly [1 - <i>Accuracy</i>]. <br> <br>

  	<i> Precision </i> gives us percentage of times when the model predicted a certain class, and how often it was right. This is could be like looking at accuracy of prediction of a particular class. When the model predicted TRUE how often was it right.  <br> 
   <sup> TP </sup>/<sub><i>(TP + FN)</i></sub> <br><br> 

  	<i> Recall/Sensitivity </i> is the percentage of times a particular class was predicted correctly. When the actual value is TRUE how often did the model correctly predict the value to be TRUE. <br>
    <sup> TP </sup>/<sub><i>(TP + FP)</i></sub> <br><br> 

  	Because we would like a model to be high for both precision and recall and therefore there is another metric that is created as a result of considering both metrics, called an <i>F-measure (F1-Score)</i>. It is the Harmonic mean of the two measures. <br>
   <sup> (2 X <i>Precision</i> X <i>Recall</i>)</sup>/<sub><i>(Precision</i>+<i>Recall)</i></sub> <br><br> 


   <i>Specificity</i> is like if we were looking at recall but for actual FALSE. When the actual value is FALSE how often did the model correctly predict the value to be FALSE. <br>
   <sup> TN </sup>/<sub><i>(TN + FP)</i></sub> <br><br> 

 This <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/the-5-classification-evaluation-metrics-you-must-know-aa97784ff226" target="_blank"> medium </a> article tells us when to use which metric. The article also introduces the concept of a weighted <i> F1 score</i> as we don't always weight the <i>precision</i> and <i>recall</i> the same <br>

   <sup> (1+ &beta;&sup2;)(<i>Precision</i> X <i>Recall</i>) </sup>/<sub><i>( ( &beta;&sup2; X  Precision ) + Recall)</i></sub> <br>
   where &beta; times as importance to <i>Recall</i> as <i>Precision</i> <br> 
<br> 
   This same article also has 3 more metrics, that haven't been discussed here, i.e. Logloss/Binary Crossentropy, Categorical Crossentropy and Area under the Curve (AUC). Also note that crossentropy's are susceptible to class imbalance and it is suggested that one uses a weighted approach.

  	The images we see on the right is almost like a follow-up on a previous post I had about defining roles in the <a href='#datasicenceprocess'> Data Science process</a>. I have seen the images all over LinkedIn but they do seem to originate from the <a href='https://www.fireblazeaischool.in/'  target="_blank" > Fireblaze AI school </a>(an online ed-tech platform aiming to train and upskill people in data-driven solutions). From these images we can see the similarities and differences between the roles. With these images, I can say that I have studied to be a data scientist through my statistics undergraduate and honours and my masters, but I am currently getting more experience as a data analyst in my current position. I hope these images are informative and allows you to realise what role you fall into.
