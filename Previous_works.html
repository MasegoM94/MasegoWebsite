  <div class="Row" id="rcorners3">
  <p style="color:white"> While I was doing my Masters, we had a course called Data Visualisation presented by <a href="https://people.cs.uct.ac.za/~mkuttel/" target="_blank">Associate Professor Michelle Kuttel</a> . <i>Alternative</i>, is the best way I can describe it. At first, I think most of the people in our class were confused at her approach. It was very different. She was trying to force us to become more creative and not be limited by technology. It was a huge adjustment as I see myself as an extreme left brainer. My degrees before that were very logical and analytical and although problem solving does require some sort of creativity, I mostly dealt with problem solving that required more logic than creativity. But Prof. Kuttel had a way of getting us to explore our creativity and honestly made us look at colour and objects differently. I have to thank her for that. With half of my course focusing on Data Science, we assumed that there would be coding involved in this course but Prof Kuttel didn't want us to be restricted by software. What has been attached here is an image of our final design for a project we had to do for the course. It looks at the language distribution in South Africa. Inspiration for this came from the cultural adjustment I had to make when moving from Gauteng to the Cape Town in the Western Cape. In Gauteng, one can generally speak any bantu language and the other would be able to understand even if it isn't their home language. However, in Cape Town the most dominant bantu language was Xhosa and there was always a "lost-in-translation" moment happening. So we were interested to see the distribution of these bantu languages across South Africa. Our aim was to create an infographic whilst trying to add as many elements of design, for example shapes, icons, patterns and colour, as possible without overwhelming the audience with information. I don't want to explain the design too much as the aim was for the audience to deduce the information we were trying to convey. We do assume that audience does have basic knowledge of South Africa's provinces and official Bantu languages.

Many thanks to <a href="https://kuselokusi.github.io/" target="_blank"> Kuselo Ntsaluba <a> as worked on this project together.
<br>
<br>
In the future I would like to try replicate this  possibly in R or PowerBI</p>

  <div class="Row" id="rcorners3">
  <p style="color:white"> At the end of August of 2019, I was fortunate enough to attend the deep learning Indaba that was hosted by Kenyatta University in Kenya. It was such a humbling experience. I have not been to Kenya before and it was eye-opening to see an African country outside the Southern Africa region and it made me grateful for the architecture we have back in South Africa and that we as African countries really need to support each other more when it comes to our economic developments. I also got to meet a number of people from all over the world that are doing great things with machine learning and data science in their respective fields. The Indaba is a data science/Artifical Intelligence(AI) conference based in Africa with a focus on African problems. There were various talks and tutorials that were given throughout the week-long conference. I was amazed by the possibilities of the application of Deep Learning (DL) in the world. I will foreveer be grateful for my employers for sending me and a group of others to the conference. As a group we gave a presentation to the business on basically what we learnt from our excursion. In my section of the presentation I gave a hort intro into what DL is and what DL is and how it fits in the concept of machine learning since DL is the focus of this particular conference. I just wanted to share my slides to that presentation. 
  	<br>
  	It was short and sweet.
  	<br>
  	<br>
  	 Enjoy :)
